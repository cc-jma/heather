# Workflows

## Demo
- Posting reviews to GitHub with code suggestions.

### LLM as a judge
- Try the `/recursive-review` command.

### Simultaneous agents
- git worktree
- clone your project twice
- background agents - cursor, claude

### Pipeline-fixer
Sick of waiting for pipelines to fail and put error into LLM? Prompt successfully used by Christoph Muth.
> “I’m currently always getting an ‘OOMKilled’ error in the GitLab pipeline. Can you use glab to read the logs, fix it, push the changes, and repeat that until it’s fixed?” (I had previously set up glab on my machine via a GitLab access token.)
> He then also immediately wanted to fix other things as well, but if necessary you can always revert those yourself later.
